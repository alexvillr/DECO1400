		<h1>Week 2, Exercise 1</h1>

		<h2>Did I mention we have comfy chairs?</h2>

		<p>It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself.</p>
		<p>You hit me with a cricket bat. It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. You hit me with a cricket bat. Annihilate? No. No violence. <strong> I won't stand for it.</strong> <em> Not now, not ever, do you understand me?!</em> I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?</p>

		<h2>I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks!</h2>

		<p>Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush.</p>

		<p>No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! Did I mention we have comfy chairs? I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!</p>
