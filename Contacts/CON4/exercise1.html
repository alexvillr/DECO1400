			<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Zawinski#Zawinski.27s_law_of_software_envelopment">JWZ's law</a> states that "Every program attempts to expand until it can read mail." A corollary is that every complex system expands until it becomes a bank. Yesterday, I wrote about how a <a href="http://boingboing.net/2014/03/18/how-a-coffee-order-chatbot-tur.html">chatbot for organizing coffee orders</a> became a full-fledged bank.</p>

			<p>Now, here's a <a href="http://kottke.org/14/03/the-first-national-bank-of-gamestop">4chan post</a> explaining a dumb/clever way of using Gamestop stores as fee-free banking institutions by pre-ordering (and pre-paying) for games, then cancelling your orders and getting a refund (to make a withdrawal), and ordering new games (to make a deposit). It's fee-free, and as a pre-orderer, you get all the bonus stuff (your bank pays you!).</p>

			<p>This is probably more of a reflection of the total dysfunction of banking, where low interest rates and hidden inflation, as well as high fees, conspire to bleed out savers to pay for reckless speculation, but it's still a pretty clever way of getting fee-free banking from an institution with more branches, and better hours, than many banks.</p>

			<p>Pat sez, "<a href="http://alaskarobotics.com/">Alaska Robotics News</a> is a political satire series covering the Alaska legislative session. We've had good luck at engaging law makers and have had several notable guests on the show.  U.S. Senator Mark Begich recently joined us to talk about NSA dragnet surveillance and precognitive policing.</p>

			<p>We have a small group of writers contributing the the show and enjoy a lot of support from our community. This segment was a good opportunity to get outside our local issues and poke at the boiling frog of government surveillance."</p>
