						<h2>CHAPTER I - Down the Rabbit-Hole</h2>

						<p>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister
						on the bank, and of having nothing to do:  once or twice she had
						peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no
						pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,'
						thought Alice 'without pictures or conversation?'.</p>

						<p>So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,
						for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether
						the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble
						of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White
						Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</p>

						<p>There was nothing so <em>very</em> remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so <em>very</em> much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear!  Oh dear!  I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually <em>took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket</em>, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p>

						<p>In another moment down went Alice after it, never once
						considering how in the world she was to get out again.</p>

						<h2>CHAPTER 2 - The Pool of Tears</h2>

						<p>‘Curiouser and curiouser!’ cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); ‘now I’m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!’ (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off). ‘Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I’m sure <em>I</em> shan’t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can; — but I must be kind to them,’ thought Alice, ‘or perhaps they won’t walk the way I want to go! Let me see: I’ll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.’</p>

						<p>And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. ‘They must go by the carrier,’ she thought; ‘and how funny it’ll seem, sending presents to one’s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!</p>

						<blockquote>
							<em>Alice’s Right Foot, Esq.<br />
							Hearthrug,<br />
							Near the fender,<br />
							(with Alice’s love).</em>
						</blockquote>

						<p>Oh dear, what nonsense I’m talking!’.</p>

						<p>Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.</p>
