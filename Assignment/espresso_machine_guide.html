                    Espresso is one of the most widely drunk and sought after coffee types. it consists of having a compressed ‘puck’ of coffee grinds inside of a handle often called a portafilter. These grounds then have near boiling high pressure water pushed through them. This results in a concentrated coffee drink with a layer of bubbly foam on top referred to as crema. This is considered one of the purest ways to taste coffee so is what lots of people aim for in a coffee set up. Espresso, as it is so strong and produces so little liquid, is then often diluted. If diluted with hot water this is called a long black or an americano. However you can dilute your espresso with milk in a variety of ways to create many drinks like lattes, cappucinos, flat whites, etc.

                <ol>
                    <li>Grind a weight of coffee based on your machines manual</li>
                    <li>Put the ground coffee into your portafilter</li>
                    <li>(optional) Distribute the coffee using a distribution tool
                        <ol>
                            <li>if this is a wedge tool, simply spin it on top of the ground coffee</li>
                            <li>If it is a needle tool, stir the coffee around until there are no more clumps</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Use your tamp to compress the coffee down. You can't press too hard in this situation so just try to press out as much air as you can</li>
                    <li>To put your portafilter into the machine. Start at a slight angle until you feel the handle go further into the machine then twist until the handle is perpendicular to your body</li>
                    <li>Immediately press your shot button</li>
                    <li>If you have a timed machine then simply wait for the shot to run and then follow on. 
                        <ol>
                            <li>Otherwise, press the button again once you have reached the desired weight of coffee. For two shots this is typically 36g, then half that for a single shot</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>After your coffee is extracted, move whatever cup your coffee has been brewed into and then remove the portafilter by doing the opposite action to getting it in</li>
                    <li>To empty the portafilter you can do one of two ways, if you have a dump box, one firm knock onto the bar should help the coffee leave the portafilter, if you have no dump box you can just use a spoon to scoop the grounds out. You can dispose of your groundfs into the bin or compost as coffee grounds make a great fertiliser</li>
                    <li>Rinse the portafilter out, and put back into your machine like you are making another shot</li>
                    <li>You have now successfully brewed some delicious espresso, you can now:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Pour over a cup of hot water to create a long black</li>
                            <li>pour in some textured milk on top to create a latte</li>
                            <li>with less froth you can make a flat white</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>There are endless combinations to try!</li>
                    <li>Congratulations! You have just become your very own barista</li>
                </ol>
