                    V60 is probably the most popular form of filter coffee at the moment, it has high potential for being a really nice pure cup of coffee and it is also simple and quick to produce. You can make several different volumes very easily. It is a hobbyists dream for a great cup of smooth filter coffee with lots of easy to do adjustments. While being an entry level coffee there is plenty of room to grow with having more money to spend and new tools to use to produce better and better coffee.

                    <li>Like most filter coffees we will use our ratio of 60 grams of coffee for every litre of water we are going to use</li>
                    <li>To start with, rinse the V60 paper with some boiling water after folding the edge and placing inside your V60</li>
                    <li>Now place the V60 on top of whatever you are going to brew into and then place those two together on a set of decently accurate scales</li>
                    <li>Add your ground coffee and double check the weight is right</li>
                    <li>Now, start a stopwatch and using any kind of kettle, pour in freshly boiled water onto the coffee, but only twice the weight of the amount of ground coffee you have placed inside</li>
                    <li>We will now bloom the coffee for 30-45 seconds</li>
                    <li>With the coffee now bloomed we will add about more boiling water until we have reached about 60% of our final volume</li>
                    <li>Now take a couple seconds to stir the coffee grounds up and make sure everything is wet and then give your whole apparatus a bit of a swirl</li>
                    <li>We can now add the remaining water</li>
                    <li>With all the water added, we now give the coffee another stir and a swirl, then we use a spoon to brush down the sides of the V60 to get off any particles of coffee that have gotten stuck</li>
                    <li>Now give one last swirl so that there is a nice flat bed of coffee grounds. Just like that you have a great cup of coffee</li>
