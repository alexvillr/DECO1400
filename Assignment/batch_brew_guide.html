                    Batch brew is most commonly found as a quick and easy coffee solution in cafes. It is similar in a way to American style diner coffee, however you can produce it much better than it typically will be made in those diners and produce a great coffee that you can be sipping on all day.

                    <li>To start, decide how much coffee you'd like to make. Use 60 grams of coffee for every litre of coffee you'd like to make</li>
                    <li>Grind your coffee relatively course, a 5.7 on a ditting brand grinder is typically the perfect size for the coffee grinds</li>
                    <li>Now rinse through your machine with about 250mL of cold filtered water. This will make sure that there is no buildup in the internals and also warm up your karaffe</li>
                    <li>Fold and put in your filter paper into the top part</li>
                    <li>Wet the filter paper with some hot filtered water</li>
                    <li>Put your coffee into the top compartment on top of the filter paper, then stir slightly just using your finger to create a well in the middle of the grounds</li>
                    <li>Fill up the water resovoir with cold filtered water with a volume of how much coffee you would like to make</li>
                    <li>To start set the dripper to closed so that the water will sit on the grounds</li>
                    <li>Turn the machine on and then turn it off once the water has just covered the coffee</li>
                    <li>Give the coffee a bit of a stir, then leave the coffee to bloom for 30-45 seconds</li>
                    <li>Now open the water valve and turn the machine back on (You may have to turn the machine off and on to stop it from overflowing depending on how much you are making)</li>
                    <li>Towards the end of the brew, use a spoon to brush coffee grounds off the side of the filter paper and give it a good swirl</li>
                    <li>At the end, the top part where the coffee is should be a nice flat bed of ground coffee that can be composted or binned</li>
                    <li>You now have some very nice filter coffee that can last you all day, or you can put the leftovers in the fridge for some nice iced batch for tomorrow</li>
